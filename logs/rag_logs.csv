According to the paper ""EmojiLM: Modeling the New Emoji Language"" by Letian Peng et al. (2023), emojis are used in language models (LLMs) as a way to express complex semantics and emotions in a more vivid and witty manner. The authors propose a new type of LLM, called EmojiLM, which is specialized in bidirectional English-Emoji translation.

In this context, emojis are not just used as substitutes for emotion words (e.g., happy, sad, angry), but rather as a way to perform a similar role as natural language when composing sentences with multiple emojis. The authors also mention that existing studies have focused on single emoji predictions, which they argue underestimates the expressing ability of emojis.

In summary, emojis are used in LLMs to enhance the expressiveness and emotional nuance of text-based communication, allowing for more vivid and witty expressions of complex semantics and emotions."

This involves using emojis to render requested knowledge externally or internally (Zappavigna and Doran, 2025). Additionally, LMMs like ChatGPT employ emojis to reflect platform-specific associations, such as using (penguin) for Linux and (snake) for Python (Zhou et al., 2025). These emoji usages align with human responses in most cases, demonstrating consistency across different communities and contexts (Zhou et al., 2025)."

They compensate for the loss of non-verbal cues in text-based communication, creating a relaxed atmosphere, promoting interaction, and reducing ambiguity in messages (Chen et al., 2024). Emojis are also used to express emotions and humor, enhance online communication, and are applied in fields such as marketing, medicine, public health, sentiment analysis, and education (Chen et al., 2024). However, their interpretation can be ambiguous and varies across individuals and cultures (Chen et al., 2024)."

How does it translate text to emojis?,"['Klein2024', 'Klein2024', 'Klein2024', 'Klein2024', 'Klein2024', 'Peng2023', 'Klein2024']","The 'Emojinize' system is a scalable and fully automatic translation system for emoji language (Klein2024; Chunk 397; (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024)). It translates text to emojis by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, using few-shot learning (Klein2024; Chunk 437; (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024)). The system considers both prior and subsequent contexts to disambiguate synonyms and harnesses the expressive power of combining multiple emojis (Klein2024; Chunk 397; (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024)). Emojinize creates a translation algorithm that translates English text into emoji language, offering a more accurate alternative to human translations (Klein2024; Chunk 437; (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024)). The system employs a stochastic process, allowing for the generation of multiple translation candidates with varying temperatures (Klein2024; Chunk 441; (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024)). An oracle model provides feedback to improve translation accuracy and prevent misunderstandings (Klein2024; Chunk 441; (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024)). Emojinize can handle both singular words and multi-word expressions, ensuring the translation's essence remains intact (Klein2024; Chunk 397; (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024))."
