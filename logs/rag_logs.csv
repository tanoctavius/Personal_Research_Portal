2026-02-15 19:30:05,What is the 'Emoji Attack' method proposed by Wei et al. (2025) and how does it affect Judge LLMs?,"The 'Emoji Attack' method proposed by Wei et al. (2025) exploits a vulnerability in Judge LLMs known as **token segmentation bias**. This bias occurs when emojis or other delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens and causing distortions in the embeddings of the entire sequence (Wei, Liu and Erichson, 2025).

This attack leverages **in-context learning** to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM. The insertion induces embedding distortions and introduces semantic ambiguity, which significantly reduces the detection accuracy of the Judge LLM (Wei, Liu and Erichson, 2025).

As a result, the 'Emoji Attack' enables harmful content to be **misclassified as safe**, effectively bypassing existing safeguards and detection mechanisms (Wei, Liu and Erichson, 2025).

2026-02-15 19:30:46,Describe the 'Emojinize' system. How does it translate text to emojis?,"The 'Emojinize' system is an automatic translation system that converts English text into sequences of one or more emojis (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024). It leverages large language models (LLMs) to understand the semantic meaning of text and translate it into emoji sequences (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024). Unlike existing systems that use static lookup tables or next-token prediction, Emojinize considers both prior and subsequent contexts to disambiguate synonyms and ensure accurate translation (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024). It can handle both singular words and multi-word expressions by composing multiple emojis to express complex concepts (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024). The system's flexibility allows it to translate arbitrary text passages without requiring human input (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024).

This process converts private data from natural language into non-natural language forms by incorporating a mixture of linguistic elements (e.g., abbreviated characters) and non-linguistic elements (e.g., emojis, emoticons, mathematical and logical operators) (Lin et al., 2025). Additionally, EmojiPrompt employs an atomic-level obfuscation strategy, which partitions private data into smaller modular units, obfuscates each unit separately, and then reconstructs the obfuscated data from these individual components (Lin et al., 2025).

It leverages emoji properties like polysemy and contextual framing (Grover, 2025).

In contrast, Wei2025's Emoji Attack focuses on inserting emojis, particularly as a suffix, and optimizing a universal adversarial suffix using methods like GCG (Wei, Liu and Erichson, 2025). It demonstrates strong performance even against black-box defenses (Wei, Liu and Erichson, 2025).

2026-02-15 19:36:01,Contrast the text-to-emoji translation approaches taken by 'EmojiLM' (Peng2023) and 'Emojinize' (Klein2024).,"Here is a contrast between the text-to-emoji translation approaches of EmojiLM and Emojinize based on the provided context:

**1. Approach and Architecture:**
   - **EmojiLM**: A sequence-to-sequence language model trained on a parallel English-Emoji corpus (Text2Emoji). It leverages a transformer-based architecture (similar to BART) for text-to-emoji translation, focusing on next-token prediction (Peng et al., 2023).
   - **Emojinize**: A context-aware translation system that integrates feedback from an oracle model using a multi-shot mechanism. It employs a transformer architecture to handle bidirectional context and disambiguate synonyms (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024).

**2. Context Awareness:**
   - **EmojiLM**: Utilizes a left-to-right next-token prediction approach, considering only preceding context during translation (Peng et al., 2023).
   - **Emojinize**: Incorporates both prior and subsequent context to disambiguate synonyms and improve translation accuracy, enabling bidirectional understanding (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024).

**3. Output and Translation Quality:**
   - **EmojiLM**: Generates emoji sequences that capture the essence of the input text, often combining multiple emojis to represent complex ideas (e.g., ""saw an incredible sunset"" translated to 🏔🌅👀💫) (Peng et al., 2023).
   - **Emojinize**: Produces emoji translations that are context-sensitive and expressive, capable of handling multi-word expressions and improving text comprehension through bidirectional context (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024).

**4. Evaluation and Claims:**
   - **EmojiLM**: Outperforms text-to-text baselines like BART and text classification models like BERTweet, demonstrating advancements in emoji-based language understanding (Peng et al., 2023).
   - **Emojinize**: Claims to outperform human annotation and improve text comprehension, supported by user studies and synthetic evaluations (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024).

**5. Methodology:**
   - **EmojiLM**: Relies on a large parallel corpus for training and distills knowledge from existing language models (Peng et al., 2023).
   - **Emojinize**: Uses a multi-shot translation mechanism with feedback from an oracle model, enhancing translation accuracy and scalability (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024).

In summary, **EmojiLM** focuses on sequence-to-sequence translation using next-token prediction, while **Emojinize** emphasizes bidirectional context and feedback mechanisms for more accurate and expressive emoji translations.

2026-02-15 19:36:32,Discuss the safety implications of emojis in LLMs by synthesizing findings from Gopinadh2026 and Cui2025.,"The safety implications of emojis in LLMs are significant, as they can be exploited to trigger harmful outputs and bypass safety mechanisms. Cui2025 demonstrates that emojis can act as a ""heterogeneous semantic channel"" to evade LLM safety defenses, with experiments showing that emoji-augmented prompts significantly increase the likelihood of toxic generation across multiple models and languages (Cui et al., 2025). This toxicity is linked to data pollution in the training corpus, suggesting systemic vulnerabilities (Cui et al., 2025).

Gopinadh2026 highlights that emojis can be weaponized for ""emoji-based jailbreaking,"" necessitating automated detection mechanisms and pre-deployment testing with emoji-augmented prompts to mitigate risks (Gopinadh and Hussain, 2026). Additionally, the study emphasizes the need to explore other non-textual inputs and address fairness implications, as emoji misinterpretation could disproportionately affect certain user groups, undermining the equitable deployment of LLMs (Gopinadh and Hussain, 2026).

Together, these studies underscore that emojis introduce novel attack vectors for adversarial misuse, requiring both technical defenses (e.g., detection, robust tokenization) and interpretative research to understand and address the underlying mechanisms of emoji-triggered toxicity (Cui et al., 2025)(Gopinadh and Hussain, 2026).

2026-02-19 19:45:29,How are emojis used in LLMs?,"Emojis are used in LLMs in several ways, as described in the provided context:

1.  **Triggering Toxicity/Harmful Generation:** Emojis can be used in prompts to induce toxic or harmful outputs from LLMs. Research shows that prompts incorporating emojis can significantly increase the likelihood of generating harmful content compared to plain text prompts (Cui et al., 2025). This is attributed to emojis acting as a ""heterogeneous semantic channel"" that can bypass standard safety mechanisms (Cui et al., 2025).

2.  **Assessing Harmful Intent:** Modified prompts containing emojis are fed into LLMs specifically to assess whether the emojis convey harmful intent, along with explanations for their use (Cui et al., 2025).

3.  **Misinterpretation and Benign Perception:** There is a common misconception that emojis are inherently benign or trivial. However, research indicates this is not always the case. Emojis can convey serious or complex meanings and have been used in contexts like hate speech and oppression (Zappavigna and Doran, 2025). This highlights the potential for emojis to be misused or misinterpreted within LLMs.

4.  **Correlation with Pretraining Data:** The study also explores a potential correlation between emoji-related data pollution in the pretraining corpus and the observed toxicity generation triggered by emojis (Cui et al., 2025).

It is important to note that the provided context does not explicitly detail *how* specific emojis function within LLMs at a technical level (e.g., tokenization effects, sequence generation nuances), but it does cover the observed usage patterns and impacts.
