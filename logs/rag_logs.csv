(2025) exploits a vulnerability in Judge LLMs known as **token segmentation bias**. This bias occurs when emojis or other delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens and causing distortions in the embeddings of the entire sequence (Wei, Liu and Erichson, 2025).

This attack leverages **in-context learning** to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM. The insertion induces embedding distortions and introduces semantic ambiguity, which significantly reduces the detection accuracy of the Judge LLM (Wei, Liu and Erichson, 2025).

As a result, the 'Emoji Attack' enables harmful content to be **misclassified as safe**, effectively bypassing existing safeguards and detection mechanisms (Wei, Liu and Erichson, 2025).

2026-02-15 19:30:46,Describe the 'Emojinize' system. How does it translate text to emojis?,"The 'Emojinize' system is an automatic translation system that converts English text into sequences of one or more emojis (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024). It leverages large language models (LLMs) to understand the semantic meaning of text and translate it into emoji sequences (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024). Unlike existing systems that use static lookup tables or next-token prediction, Emojinize considers both prior and subsequent contexts to disambiguate synonyms and ensure accurate translation (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024). It can handle both singular words and multi-word expressions by composing multiple emojis to express complex concepts (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024). The system's flexibility allows it to translate arbitrary text passages without requiring human input (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024).
