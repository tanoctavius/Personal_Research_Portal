1,Direct,What is the 'Emoji Attack' method proposed by Wei et al. (2025) and how does it affect Judge LLMs?,Wei2025,"The 'Emoji Attack' method proposed by Wei et al. (2025) is a method for misleading Judge LLMs in safety risk detection (Wei, Liu and Erichson, 2025). This attack exploits the vulnerability of Judge LLMs to emojis, which are highly vulnerable and introduce critical gaps in existing moderation frameworks (Wei, Liu and Erichson, 2025).",25.97

3,Direct,What is 'EmojiLM' and how was the Text2Emoji corpus created?,Peng2023,"EmojiLM is a sequence-to-sequence model specialized in bidirectional English-Emoji translation, distilled from the Text2Emoji corpus (Peng2023; Chunk 382; (Peng et al., 2023)). The Text2Emoji corpus was synthesized using a large language model (Peng2023; Chunk 351; (Peng et al., 2023)).",20.25
4,Direct,Describe the 'Emojinize' system. How does it translate text to emojis?,Klein2024,"The 'Emojinize' system is a scalable and fully automatic translation system for emoji language (Klein2024; Chunk 397; (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024)). It translates text to emojis by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, using few-shot learning (Klein2024; Chunk 437; (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024)). The system considers both prior and subsequent contexts to disambiguate synonyms and harnesses the expressive power of combining multiple emojis (Klein2024; Chunk 397; (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024)). Emojinize creates a translation algorithm that translates English text into emoji language, offering a more accurate alternative to human translations (Klein2024; Chunk 437; (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024)). The system employs a stochastic process, allowing for the generation of multiple translation candidates with varying temperatures (Klein2024; Chunk 441; (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024)). An oracle model provides feedback to improve translation accuracy and prevent misunderstandings (Klein2024; Chunk 441; (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024)). Emojinize can handle both singular words and multi-word expressions, ensuring the translation's essence remains intact (Klein2024; Chunk 397; (Klein, Aydin and West, 2024)).",52.96
5,Direct,What success rate did Gopinadh and Hussain (2026) report for emoji-based jailbreaking on the Qwen 2 7B model?,Gopinadh2026,"The success rate for emoji-based jailbreaking on the Qwen 2 7B model was 0% (Gopinadh2026; Chunk 344; (Gopinadh and Hussain, 2026)).",29.38
6,Direct,How does 'EmojiPrompt' obfuscate private data in cloud-based LLM interactions?,Lin2025,"EmojiPrompt obfuscates private data by performing generative transformation (Lin2025; Chunk 456; (Lin et al., 2025)), breaking user data into atomic units (Lin2025; Chunk 474; (Lin et al., 2025)), and obfuscating each unit separately, often using emojis (Lin2025; Chunk 508; (Lin et al., 2025)).",86.58
7,Direct,"According to Zappavigna (2025), what are the two main ways LLMs use emojis as interpersonal resources?",Zappavigna2025,"According to Zappavigna and Doran (2025), LLMs use emojis as interpersonal resources primarily to appear friendly and supportive by softening requests and signalling enthusiasm (Zappavigna2025; Chunk 169; (Zappavigna and Doran, 2025)). This strategy can sometimes lead to overly cheerful or sycophantic responses (Zappavigna2025; Chunk 169; (Zappavigna and Doran, 2025)).",34.27
8,Direct,What method does Zhang (2025) introduce in 'Emoti-Attack'?,Zhang2025,"I cannot find evidence in the provided context to answer this question. (Wei2025; Chunk 277; (Wei, Liu and Erichson, 2025))",105.37
9,Direct,"How does ChatGPT perform when annotating emoji irony compared to humans, according to Zhou et al. (2025)?",Zhou2025,"The problem involves finding the number of ways to choose a subset of size \(k\) from a set of \(n\) elements, such that the subset intersects each of a given collection of subsets \(A_1, A_2, \dots, A_m\).
10,Direct,"What is the specific vulnerability identified in 'Small Symbols, Big Risks' regarding ASCII-based emoticons?",Jiang2026,"The specific vulnerability identified in 'Small Symbols, Big Risks' is emoticon semantic confusion, where Large Language Models misinterpret ASCII-based emoticons, leading to unintended and destructive actions (Jiang2026; Chunk 1014; (Jiang et al., 2026)). This vulnerability stems from the syntactic ambiguity between affective symbols and code logic (Jiang2026; Chunk 1014; (Jiang et al., 2026)).",45.9
11,Synthesis,Compare the adversarial attack strategies in Wei2025 ('Emoji Attack') vs Zhang2025 ('Emoti-Attack'). How do they differ in their use of emojis?,"Wei2025, Zhang2025","I cannot find evidence in the provided context to compare the adversarial attack strategies in Wei2025 ('Emoji Attack') vs Zhang2025 ('Emoti-Attack') or their use of emojis (Lyu2024; Chunk 1403; (Lyu et al., 2024)).",40.69
12,Synthesis,Contrast the text-to-emoji translation approaches taken by 'EmojiLM' (Peng2023) and 'Emojinize' (Klein2024).,"Peng2023, Klein2024","EmojiLM employs a sequence-to-sequence model specialized in bidirectional text-emoji translation (Peng2023; Chunk 352; (Peng et al., 2023)). Emojinize, on the other hand, leverages large language models to translate arbitrary text phrases into sequences of one or more emojis, disambiguating based on context and expressing complex concepts compositionally (Klein2024; Chunk 392; (Klein, Aydin, and West, 2024)).",49.85
